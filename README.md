CSX-351 Homework 2 
Searching and Sorting

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice working with arrays, passing them to functions, sorting, searching and reading and writing text files.
In this program you will read two files and store their contents in arrays.  You will sort both arrays, and then search an array for each element of the second array.

Program Steps
Open two input files and one output file.
Input files
HW2-dictionary.txt - this file contains 16000 words
HW2-keywords.txt - this file contains 84 words
Read in these two files and store their contents in 2 arrays of strings.  
Sort both arrays using either a selection sort, bubble sort or insertion sort.  Use the same sort routine for sorting both arrays.  
Search the dictionary array for each keyword.  If the keyword is not present in the dictionary array, write a message to the output file that the keyword is not found in the dictionary (see sample output below).  Count the number of keywords not found.  You will print this number at the end of the program.

Output Details

Number of keywords not found = ??   <= the number is between 20 and 30
Required file output
keyword not found: alignas
keyword not found: alignof
keyword not found: and_eq
keyword not found: asm
keyword not found: auto
keyword not found: bitand
keyword not found: bitor
keyword not found: char16_t
keyword not found: char32_t
keyword not found: compl
